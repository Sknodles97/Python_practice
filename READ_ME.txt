#CHEM5830 Final Project
#Sierra Knodle 

This script was developed as a critical foundation to future analysis data that is often difficult to analyze (from both my own experience, and hearing from those of colleagues). Propka files present a vast variety of data, with often similar terms. Despite the difficulty, this data is critical and must be effectively analyzed.

 Though relatively simple; this script seeks to find information in the file in an innovative way. It also intends to organize the data in such a way that it might be easily manipulated for further calculations, graphing, etc. Here, the method was sorting 'by residue' by utilizing the consistent value, per residue, of side-chain pkas. A sample data file is attached (Sample_Data.txt), extracted from a previous calculation I had run.
